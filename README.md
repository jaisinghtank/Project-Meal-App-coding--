# Project-Meal-App-coding--

The Meal App is a web application that allows users to search for and discover new meals and recipes. Users can search for meals by name, ingredient, or category, and can also save their favourite meals for quick access later. The app also includes a feature to watch recipe videos on youtube. This app is part of Coding Ninjas CC Course.
